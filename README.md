# Movie Search App üçø

This movie search app is a react application that utilizes the Movie Database API. Some of the key features built are the ability to favorite movies. This project showcases the my ability and general interest of animations. This app utilizes the Framer-motion library to create beautiful seamless animations.

Some of challenges faced when creating this project were the library itself as I had never played with Framer-motion before and the animations of the favorites layout. The animation of the favorites layout was particularly tricky because of the movement from one component to another.

Some features I'd like to add in the future would be the ability for the user to lookup any movie they'd like and the layout and animation of the description of the movies which I'd like to change to make it its own page.
